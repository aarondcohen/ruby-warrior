Given a warrior
  When there is a captive in front
    Save the captive
  When there is an enemy in front
    Attack the enemy
  When the path is clear
    When taking damage
      Walk forward
    When at partial health
      Rest up
    When at full health
      Walk forward


A warrior is taking damage when:
- the health for the current turn is less than the health for the previous turn
